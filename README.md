# BetterLtd_Software

## !!The project needs to be connected to a database and have a corresponding table, att etc. in order to work, we were using Xmapp

This was a multi-person project of several months' duration. Before the Prototype, we had to write a large report (including: Problem Findings, Functional/non Requirement, Design of the proposed system, User Guide, etc.) based on the analysis of the fictitious use case and background information.

# Introduction in the report

Better Limited is a Hong Kong-based electronic appliance retail store. The Companyâ€™s main business is to sell small to large appliances, such as hairdryers, TV, Air-Conditioner, There are currently 2 stores in Kowloon Bay and Tsuen Wan. There is only one office located at Kowloon Bay and a 6000sq/ft warehouse is sitting next to the office. The current internal system is completely physical and relies on paperwork, basically, all the receipts, invoices, documents, orders to vendors...etc, are all on paper.

As Better Limited is preparing to expand its business to other regions. Therefore, it is necessary to computerise the management system to solve the existing problems and improve the company's business. Currently, the company has many problems that need to be solved in order to avoid the expansion of business and further aggravate the problems, such as the current staff confusion, low security, inefficient inventory, and manual collection of receipts and documents will cause more inconvenience to the company in the future.

# Some Problem of Findings example in the report

### In-store stock checking procedure inefficient
Manual Stock Checking requires sales to get in and out of the stock room frequently to check the item quantity, which is Inefficient and labour intensive.

solution: Build an interface that allows sales to check the quantity of the goods on the computer in-store

### Delivery arrangement complicated
Delivery workman arrangement procedure is complicated because every job is arranged by sales on phone calls which is inefficient and mistakes are easily made.

solution: Build a function where you can assign a job.

### Stocking records
The current Stocking records are primitive, records are handwritten in paper by the clerk, item information search and modification are inefficient.

solution: Build a database to store all the goods information into the database.
